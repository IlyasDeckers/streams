==============

Provides a simple abstraction over streams of data.

This library is used in `Guzzle 4 <https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle>`_ and is
an implementation of the proposed `PSR-7 stream interface <https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/http-message.md#34-psrhttpstreaminterface>`_.
